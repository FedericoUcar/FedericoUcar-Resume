        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Federico Ucar Cavelli, I'm 21 years old and I'm from Montevideo, Uruguay. Since I was a child I am a soccer fan and I have practiced and played it since I was 3 years old. Soccer had a great impact on me, through the unique experiences I lived, physically, mentally, athletically and in the way I see things in life. This sport made me the person I am today. Being my father a successful economist, I never had to deal with economic problems. In Uruguay I never missed anything and I always got first level education. Unlike all my classmates, it was soccer that made me see "the other side" of life, what made me a humble person who appreciates what he has every day.<br><br>

        It was in 2011, when I was 13 years old, that I began to be interested in helping people in need. In soccer I became friends, some considered brothers, who had to live with poverty, with eating once a day (hopefully), so it was at that age that I became aware of the situation and felt it was my duty and my will to be able to help those who need. It was the high school I attended (St. Patrick's College) that allowed me to start doing different social works. From entertaining children in a neighborhood near my high school, to being part of the ONG and traveling to South Africa, where I had one of the best experiences of my life and taught me that the detail that for one may be the least for another It can be the biggest gift in the world.<br><br>

        Finally, it was in 2017 where I opted for the biggest change of my life. I decided to leave my comfort zone, leave my family, leave my culture and everything I was used to and chose the greatest adventure of my life that is still in progress. The change was moving to the United States. I had the opportunity to decide for a world-class education and at the same time be able to practice the sport that I love. In August 2017 I started my university career at Wayland Baptist University in Plianview, TX with a sports scholarship in soccer. While it is a university with not many students, the diversity there was was surprising. Thanks to the possibility of meeting people from all over the world, I was able to take small things from each culture that have helped me as tools for life in the way of doing, thinking and seeing the things of life. After being two years in Texas and having enjoyed academic and sports success (for example, two semesters reaching 4.0 in GPA and being national champions of the NAIA in soccer and having been named the best offensive player in the championship), I opted for another change and that took me to Riverside, CA and being part of UCR also with a sports scholarship in soccer. To this day I continue to learn something more every day and I continue to enjoy this adventure and continue to expand my story.
